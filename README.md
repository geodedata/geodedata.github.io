Geode Data is an archiving organisation that aims to archive everything, well everything that isn't complete degeneracy. That type of content can die and be lit on fire. Our main focus is on everything that is: educational, useful, historical, or anything that we collectively decide to be considered worthy enough to be archived. This, alongside the entire internet.
